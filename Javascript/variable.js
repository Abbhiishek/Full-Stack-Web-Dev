// well variables are something which can store a sort of data and later 

// in the code we can use that for our logics and operations 


// to declare a variable we generally use two type of keywords

// 1. let  // this type of variable can be re assigned with the new value down the code  
// 2. const // with const its not true its like a variable which has a constant value ......



const constkeyword = "This is a const variable and can't be reassigned by the code and the user ..."

let letkeyword = "This is a let variable and can be reassigned by the code and the user ..."

console.log(constkeyword)
console.log(letkeyword)
